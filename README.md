## Overview
Flatshare Splitter is a Python CLI (Command-Line Interface) application designed to fairly split the utility bill among flatmates based on the number of days they stayed in the house during the billing period. The application leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance modularity and maintainability.

The application also shares the generated PDF report using the Filestack API. However, users can modify the code to use any other cloud service for file sharing. The PDF bill design is basic and can be customized further depending on user preference and needs.

## Features
- **Bill Calculation**: Calculate the share of the bill each flatmate needs to pay based on their days of stay.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Generate a PDF report summarizing the bill details and each flatmate's share.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensure that user inputs are correctly formatted and valid.
- **File Sharing**: Share the generated PDF report using the Filestack API.
- **Customizable File Sharing**: Shares the generated PDF report using the Filestack API, with the option to modify the code for using other cloud services.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors during the file-sharing process.

## Technologies Used
- **Filestack**: Used for uploading and sharing files via the cloud.
- **FPDF**: Used for generating PDF documents in Python.
- **python-dotenv**: Used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **webbrowser**: Used for opening URLs in a web browser.
- **datetime**: Used for manipulating dates and times in Python.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/emads22/Flatshare-Splitter.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
    ```sh
    cd Flatshare-Splitter
    ```
3. **Ensure Python 3.x is Installed**: Check your Python version using:
    ```sh
    python --version
    ```
4. **Install Required Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. **Configure Necessary Parameters in `constants.py`**:
   - Edit `constants.py` to set any required constants for the project, such as `FILESTACK_API_KEY`.

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. **Enter Bill Details**:
   - Follow the prompts to enter the total bill amount, bill period, and each flatmate's name and days stayed.
3. **View Calculation Results**:
   - The script will calculate and print each flatmate's share of the bill.
4. **Generate PDF Report**:
   - A PDF report will be generated summarizing the bill details and each flatmate's share.
5. **Share the PDF Report**:
   - The generated PDF report will be uploaded using the Filestack API, and a URL link to the report will be provided.
   - If an error occurs during the file-sharing process, an error message will be displayed.

## Example
Here’s an example of how to use the Flatmates Bill application:

1. **Run the script**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. **Input the following when prompted**:
    - **Total Bill Amount**: `$300`
    - **Bill Period**: `May 2024`
    - **Flatmate 1 Name**: `Alice`
    - **Days Stayed by Alice**: `20`
    - **Flatmate 2 Name**: `Bob`
    - **Days Stayed by Bob**: `10`
3. **The script will output**:
    ```sh
    Alice pays: $200.00
    Bob pays: $100.00
    ```
4. **Check the project directory for a PDF report named `May_2024_Bill.pdf`**.
5. **The terminal will display a URL to the shared PDF report**:
    ```sh
    --- PDF Flatmates Bill generated successfully.

## Files Description
- **main.py**: The main script that runs the application, handles user input, calculates bill shares, and generates the PDF report.
- **app_utils.py**: Contains utility functions for validating user input (float, integer, date).
- **constants.py**: Defines constants used throughout the project, such as file paths and API keys.
- **classes.py**: Defines the core classes for the application:
  - `Bill`: Represents the bill with total amount and billing period.
  - `Flatmate`: Represents a flatmate with name and days stayed in the house, and calculates their share of the bill.
  - `PdfReport`: Generates a PDF report of the bill and flatmates' shares.
  - `FileShare`: Handles sharing the PDF report using the Filestack API.
